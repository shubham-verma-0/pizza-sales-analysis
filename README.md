🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis
*Overview*

In this project, I analyzed pizza sales data to understand overall business performance, customer ordering behavior, and product-level trends.
The goal of this analysis was to convert raw transactional data into clear business insights that can support decision-making related to sales, inventory, and operations.

I used SQL for data analysis and Power BI for dashboard-based visualization, following a real-world analytics workflow.

>>>>>Business Problem

A pizza restaurant wants to answer key business questions such as:
Which pizzas generate the most and least revenue?
When do customers place the highest number of orders?
How do pizza size and category affect sales performance?
Which products should be promoted or reconsidered?

>>>>> Objectives

Measure overall sales and revenue performance
Identify high-performing and low-performing pizzas
Analyze order trends across days and months
Understand customer purchasing behavior

📊 Insights & Storytelling (Dashboard Interpretation)


This section explains the key insights derived from the Power BI dashboard, along with the possible business reasons behind observed trends. The focus is on business interpretation, not just numbers.

1. Overall Business Performance (KPIs)

![KPI Dashboard](images/dashboard.png)

- **Total Revenue:** ~$817.86K  
- **Total Orders:** ~21,350  
- **Total Pizzas Sold:** ~49,574  
- **Average Order Value (AOV):** ~$38.31  
- **Average Pizzas per Order:** ~2.32
  
>>>>> Insight

Customers typically order more than one pizza per order, indicating group or family-based purchasing behavior rather than individual orders.
Business Reason
Pizza is often consumed in groups, especially during weekends and evenings, which increases both order value and quantity per order.

2. Daily Order Trend (Weekday Analysis)
Observation

Orders gradually increase from Sunday to Friday

Friday has the highest number of orders

Slight drop observed on Saturday

Insight

Peak demand occurs on Friday and Saturday evenings

Weekdays show stable but lower demand compared to weekends

Business Reason

End-of-week social gatherings, office parties, and family dinners drive higher sales

Saturday drop may be due to customers preferring dine-out or alternative food options

3. Monthly Order Trend (Seasonality)

Observation

July shows the highest order volume

Strong performance also seen in January

Noticeable dip during September and October

Insight

Sales show seasonal patterns

Certain months consistently outperform others

Business Reason

July: Holiday season, summer breaks, and increased leisure time

January: New Year celebrations and promotional offers

September–October: Festival spending shifts towards home-cooked or traditional foods

4. Sales by Pizza Category

Category Contribution

Classic category contributes the highest revenue and orders

Supreme and Chicken categories follow closely

Veggie category contributes the least

Insight

Customers show a strong preference for classic and familiar flavors.

Business Reason

Classic pizzas appeal to a broader audience

They are safer choices for group orders

Veggie pizzas may cater to a smaller niche audience

5. Sales by Pizza Size

Size Contribution

Large pizzas generate the highest share of sales

Medium size is the second most popular

Very low contribution from X-Large and XX-Large

Insight

Customers prefer value-for-money sizes rather than extremely large options.

Large pizzas balance price and quantity

Extra-large pizzas may be perceived as expensive or unnecessary for most customers

7. Top 5 Pizzas by Quantity Sold

9. Bottom 5 Pizzas – Revenue, Quantity & Orders
